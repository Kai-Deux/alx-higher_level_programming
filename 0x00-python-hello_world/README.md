# CONCEPTS

For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:
- [Python programming](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/550)

## Author’s disclaimer 

> Welcome to the Python world!
> The first projects are more "C-oriented" - no tricks, no funky syntax - simple!
> If you've already played with Python, don't worry, fun things will come.
> You'll soon find that with Python (and the majority of higher level languages), there are ten 
> different ways to do the same thing. Some tasks will expect only one implementation, while other tasks will have multiple possible implementations.
> Like C, Python also has a linter / style guide like Betty, called PEP8, also now known as PyCode.

Enjoy!
